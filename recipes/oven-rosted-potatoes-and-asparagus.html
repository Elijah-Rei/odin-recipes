    <p>These garlicky roasted potatoes and asparagus are easy and delicious served either hot or cold. Rosemary and thyme give it a sophisticated flavor. Try adding a little chopped red pepper too — yum!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds red potatoes, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons dried rosemary</li> 
        <li>4 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Step 1 </strong> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion and garlic in oil until tender. Add mushrooms and fry until they begin to shrink, about 3 to 4 minutes. Toss in spinach and sauté, stirring constantly for a few minutes, until spinach is wilted.</li>
        <li> <strong> Step 2 </strong> Add vinegar, stirring constantly until it is absorbed, then stir in white wine. Reduce heat to low and simmer until wine is almost completely absorbed.</li>
        <li> <strong> Step 3 </strong> Season with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle with fresh parsley. Serve hot.</li>
        <li> <strong> Step 4</strong> Mix in asparagus, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and continue to cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li> <strong> Step 5</strong> Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove foil and cook until potatoes are lightly browned, 5 to 10 more minutes. Season with pepper.</li>
    </ol>
